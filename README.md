## Symitar for Sublime 2/3

### Goals
Currently, this is my solution for the replacement of PowerOn Studio in Sublime. It's far from it right now, but it is aiming high!

- &#8864; Syntax Highlighting
- &#8864; Code Snippets
- &#8864; Tabbed Editing (Built-in w/ Sublime)
- &#8864; Modified Solarized Themes for Symitar
- &#8864; Additional Theme Customizability (Built-in w/ Sublime)
- &#8864; Code Folding
- &#9723; Auto-complete 
- &#9723; Run Reports From Editor
- &#9723; Linting
- &#9723; Compliation & Errors

### Installation
#### Package Control
The recommended way is to use [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/).

1. Open Command Palette using menu item `Tools -> Command Palette...` (Shift+Command+P on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows / Linux).
2. Choose `Package Control: Install Package`.
3. Find `Symitar` and hit Enter.

#### Manual
Manual installation through a git cloned repository or downloan and extract of files should work, but is not garunteed to work. Please use package control if possible.
